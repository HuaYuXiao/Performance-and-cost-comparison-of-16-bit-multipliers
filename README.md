# Performance-and-cost-comparison-of-16-bit-multipliers

Simulate and synthesize the two designs of a 16-bit adder-based multipliers. Examine the synthesized RTL schematics, and compare the performance of the different designs in terms of the device utilization, delay, etc.

## combinational design

(referring to the on P185-191)



## repetitive-addition design

(referring to the on P241-259)



## pipelined design

(referring to the one on P317-330).

Develop an n-bit pipeline design of multiplier where n may be an integer from 1 to 32. Perform the post-layout simulation of the design, and find out the delay, throughput, device utilization, etc., and compare them with that of designs in (1).
